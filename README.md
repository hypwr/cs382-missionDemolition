# Mission Demolition
For my addition to the game, I chose to add extra wall types:
1. A breakable wall that is destroyed on contact with the projectile.
2. A denser wall that doesn't move as easily which allows for more stability on some of the castles.
This allows for more replayablity between castles and made some of the castles more playable overall, as they're less likely to clutter pieces over the goal.
